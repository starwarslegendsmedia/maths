// numbers they mark are always the same three on the quarter-half line, and the unit fraction asked is left of the other
// two on the estimate line whenever a half decides it, so letters left to right would often make the answer A); the
// cake shown as a strip; vs-half asked both ways round; the story contexts (CONTEXTS), each kind of story a third of the
// time; F4's compare and order within one family and never all unit fractions (those are frac-unit-compare's). Every
// problem is drawn from a list made once of every one the plan allows (plan, "Rules every fraction
// generator keeps"): the key first, each as often as the others; then its class where it has two (a compare with a half
// in 1 of 4, an estimate with both other letters past 1/2 in 1 of 3; F5's related pair, and its sub in the Example's
// words half the time; F6's whole from a part as a number or a length of tape); then a problem, each in its class as often
// as the others, and with opts.also only one both ways fit. F6's story contexts (AMOUNTS) and the things shared are
// chosen for this game too, and the share's things 2 to 4, so a strip a thing fits the picture's 4 rows (plan F6).
