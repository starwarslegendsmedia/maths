// Ways to work a sum, kept as data (decided 17 October 2026: more than one way to do the maths, more of them as it
// gets more complex, and changeable as time goes on).
// A skill lists its ways in engine/skills.js (`methods`), the first taught first. Each way here has a short name, says
// which sums it fits, and builds the worked steps, picture, hint and words for any sum it fits, so the generators
// choose the numbers and the way works them. Adding a way is one entry here and its id on a skill.
//
// A sum: { op: '×', a, b } for a × b, { op: '+', a, b } or { op: '−', a, b } for a + b or a − b, or { op: '÷', n, d }
// for n ÷ d. steps(sum) -> [{ text, value? }] as in engine/items/index.js; the last step with a value gives the answer
// (the remainder, if there is one).
//
// How the game uses them (research 4.1 to 4.3): a new skill is taught its first way only (4.2), on every sum that way
// can work (one it cannot, as a subtraction with a trade for partitioning, takes the first way that can, and says so
// and why first: wayFor); once it is
// learned, the game shows her a second way beside hers on the same sum, says which takes fewer steps and lets her choose (4.1;
// one per session, never on a day something new starts: 6.8); her choice and how right and quick she is with each
// way are kept; if her way slips (under 60% of her last five since she chose), the other way is offered again (4.3).
// A facts skill's ways are bridges to remembering the fact, so a facts skill is never offered again: its measure is
// her speed on each fact. If she keeps a way other than the one school asks for (a skill's `school` way), school's
// way still comes up in one warm-up in three (reviewMethod), since that is the way school marks.
